**Project Abstract:**  
- Our project focuses on an AI-powered inventory management system that combines deep learning for image recognition with an automated backend database for real-time stock tracking. The system allows users to add, remove, and monitor inventory via a dashboard using technologies like TensorFlow, PostgreSQL, and React. It minimizes manual entry, provides alerts for low-stock conditions, and supports operational efficiency.

## Project Description

- Efficient inventory management is crucial for warehouses, retail stores, and laboratories. Our solution automates traditional manual tracking methods by integrating deep learning, backend database management, and visualization. The system captures images, recognizes stock items, and updates database counts seamlessly while supporting operational decision-making.

## User Stories and Design Diagrams

### User Stories
- [User_Stories.md](User_Stories.md)

1. As a warehouse manager, I want real-time, automated stock tracking to reduce human error and prevent reporting delays.
2. As a retail store employee, I want to scan/update items via image recognition for quick, spreadsheet-free processing.
3. As a business owner, I want low-stock alerts so I can restock items and avoid lost sales.
4. As a data analyst, I want access to inventory trends to inform decision-making.
5. As a laboratory technician, I want accurate inventory tracking to minimize waste and ensure compliance.

### Design Diagrams
Design diagrams are stored in the `Design_Diagrams` folder:

![Design Diagram 0](Design_Diagrams/design_diagram_0.png)
Fig: Level 0: Overall architecture showing input (images), processing (AI/ML), database, and dashboard/output.

![Design Diagram 1](Design_Diagrams/design_diagram_1.png)
Fig: Level 1: Data flow between input module, ML image processing, backend, dashboard.

![Design Diagram 2](Design_Diagrams/design_diagram_2.png)
Fig: Level 2: Component breakdown—camera/upload, deep learning subsystem, database tables, backend API, frontend dashboard.

### Description of the Diagrams

Design diagrams follow modular conventions, with components labeled for input, processing, storage, and visualization.  
Each diagram is structured to clarify how images are captured, processed using deep learning, routed to the database backend, and finally visualized and alerted on the dashboard.
