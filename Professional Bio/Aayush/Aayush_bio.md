## **Co-op Work Experience**



* Research Intern, University of Dayton Research Institute, Dayton, Ohio (2 Semesters):
    * Developed advanced machine learning algorithms and control systems software using tools like MATLAB/Simulink, Python, and Visual C++ to enhance the performance of autonomous systems.
    * Performed detailed analysis, modeling, simulation, and testing of autonomous vehicles and dynamic systems, ensuring optimal functionality and efficiency in real-world applications.
    * Contributed to cutting-edge research in quantum algorithms and quantum computing, applying innovative solutions to machine learning and control system challenges.
* Project Management Co-op, EMCOR Facilities Services, Cincinnati, Ohio (1 Semester):
    * Led meetings and worked with the project management team to assist with writing and processing all project assignments from the proposal to the closing documents.
    * Kept track, updated, and created documents for 120+ projects and communicated effectively with PMs to resolve any problems that may have come up.
    * Worked with the project managers to analyze ways to measure the success of a project using Power BI and SmartSheet.

## **Skills**	



* Programming: Python, C++, Java, Swift
* Operating System: macOS, Windows, Linux
* Web Development: HTML, Javascript, CSS
* Database Programming: SQL
* Office Applications:  LabVIEW, MATLAB, Adobe CC, Microsoft Office, Wireshark, Power BI, Smartsheet, PostgreSQL, Tableau

## **Projects**



* Stock Price Prediction Model (Python)
    * Utilized a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast the closing prices of Apple Inc. stock, leveraging historical data spanning over a decade.
    * Employed Python libraries (yfinance, Quandl, sklearn) to fetch historical stock data, performed feature scaling using MinMaxScaler, and prepared training and testing datasets to enhance model performance and accuracy.
    * Trained the model and evaluated its performance using Root Mean Squared Error, plotted the results to compare actual vs. predicted stock prices, and showed the model's ability to predict future stock prices with a high degree of accuracy.
* Basketball Analytics Dashboard with Real-Time Data Integration (Python, SQL, Tableau)
    * Developed a real-time basketball analytics dashboard using Python, PostgreSQL, and Tableau to visualize player and team statistics from API-Basketball.
    * Integrated live data through API calls, processing player performance metrics (points, rebounds, assists) and storing them in a structured PostgreSQL database.
    * Designed interactive Tableau dashboards for comprehensive insights, including player comparisons, league trends, and predictive analytics.
