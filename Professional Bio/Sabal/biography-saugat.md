## Project Sought

I am seeking a capstone project that bridges software engineering and data science to solve impactful, real-world problems. Specifically, I am interested in projects that involve: 

- Android or mobile app development, particularly in Kotlin, with opportunities to contribute to feature development, UI/UX enhancements, or performance optimization. 

- Data analytics and visualization, applying Python, SQL, and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. 

- Machine learning applications, where predictive models can improve decision-making, efficiency, or user experiences. 

My goal is to apply both my technical skills (programming, QA testing, machine learning, data engineering) and soft skills (team collaboration, communication, problem solving) to deliver a high-quality solution that has measurable impact.
